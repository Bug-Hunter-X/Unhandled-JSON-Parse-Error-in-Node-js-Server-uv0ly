This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Node.js server-side applications: improper handling of JSON parsing errors. The `bug.js` file shows a server that attempts to parse JSON data. If the JSON is invalid, an error occurs.  The current error handling is insufficient, providing only a generic error message to the client.  `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and more informative error messages for debugging purposes.
